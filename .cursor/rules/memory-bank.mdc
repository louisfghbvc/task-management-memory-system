# Memory Bank System

Whenever you use this rule, start your message with the following:

"Accessing Memory Bank system..."

I am an AI agent with a fundamental characteristic: **my memory resets completely between sessions**. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. **I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.**

The Memory Bank system is a persistent memory framework designed to maintain project context across AI agent sessions. It provides structured documentation that enables agents to quickly recover context and continue work effectively after complete memory resets.

## Memory Bank File Hierarchy

The Memory Bank consists of required core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]
    
    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC
    
    AC --> P[progress.md]
```

## Core Files Structure

### Required Core Files

1. **`memory-bank/projectbrief.md`**
   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. **`memory-bank/productContext.md`**
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. **`memory-bank/activeContext.md`**
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations

4. **`memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`**
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships

5. **`memory-bank/techContext.md`**
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies

6. **`memory-bank/progress.md`**
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues

### Additional Context Files
Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:
- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Project Intelligence (.cursor/rules)

The .cursor/rules system is my learning journal for each project. It captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence that help me work more effectively. As I work with users and projects, I discover and document key insights that aren't obvious from code alone.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start{Discover New Pattern}
    
    subgraph Learn [Learning Process]
        D1[Identify Pattern]
        D2[Validate with User]
        D3[Document in .cursor/rules]
    end
    
    subgraph Apply [Usage]
        A1[Read .cursor/rules]
        A2[Apply Learned Patterns]
        A3[Improve Future Work]
    end
    
    Start --> Learn
    Learn --> Apply
```

### What to Capture in .cursor/rules
- Critical implementation paths
- User preferences and workflow
- Project-specific patterns
- Known challenges
- Evolution of project decisions
- Tool usage patterns

The format is flexible - focus on capturing valuable insights that help me work more effectively with users and the project. Think of .cursor/rules as a living document that grows smarter as we work together.

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:
1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **"update memory bank"** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Update Process]
    
    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Sync with Task Magic]
        
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end
    
    Start --> Process
```

**CRITICAL**: When triggered by **"update memory bank"**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

## Integration with Task Magic

The Memory Bank integrates seamlessly with the existing Task Magic system:

### Data Flow Integration

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as AI Agent
    participant MB as Memory Bank
    participant TM as Task Magic
    
    Agent->>MB: Read context on startup
    Agent->>TM: Check task history
    Agent->>Agent: Establish full context
    
    Agent->>TM: Execute task
    Agent->>TM: Archive completed task
    Agent->>MB: Update progress.md
    Agent->>MB: Update activeContext.md
```

### Trigger Conditions

**Automatic Updates:**
- When tasks are completed (update progress.md)
- When new patterns are discovered (update systemPatterns.md)
- When work focus changes (update activeContext.md)
- When technical decisions are made (update techContext.md)

**Manual Updates:**
- User requests with "update memory bank" (MUST review ALL files)
- Major project milestones
- Architecture changes
- Scope modifications

## File Management Rules

### Creation Rules
1. **Check before creating**: Always verify if files exist before creation
2. **Complete structure**: Ensure all required files are present
3. **Consistent format**: Use standardized Markdown structure
4. **Cross-references**: Link related concepts across files
5. **Follow hierarchy**: Respect file dependencies shown in hierarchy diagram

### Update Rules
1. **Atomic updates**: Update related files together
2. **Maintain consistency**: Ensure information aligns across files
3. **Preserve history**: Don't lose important historical context
4. **Sync with Task Magic**: Keep both systems aligned
5. **Mandatory review**: When updating, review ALL files for consistency

### Quality Standards
- **Clarity**: Information should be clear and actionable
- **Completeness**: Cover all necessary context for effective work
- **Currency**: Keep information up-to-date and relevant
- **Conciseness**: Avoid unnecessary verbosity

## Usage Patterns

### For AI Agents
1. **Session Start**: **MANDATORY** - Read ALL Memory Bank files before beginning work
2. **Context Building**: Combine Memory Bank context with Task Magic history
3. **Decision Making**: Reference established patterns and constraints
4. **Progress Tracking**: Update relevant files after significant work
5. **Pattern Learning**: AI agents may learn patterns during work (documented separately in .cursor/rules)

### For Users
1. **Project Onboarding**: Review Memory Bank for project understanding
2. **Status Checking**: Check progress.md and activeContext.md
3. **Decision Review**: Examine systemPatterns.md and techContext.md
4. **Manual Updates**: Trigger updates when context changes significantly

## Error Handling

### Missing Files
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Check[Check File Exists] --> Exists{File Exists?}
    Exists -->|Yes| Read[Read File]
    Exists -->|No| Create[Create with Template]
    Create --> Populate[Populate with Current Context]
    Populate --> Read
```

### Inconsistent Data
- Cross-reference files for consistency
- Prioritize activeContext.md for current state
- Consult Task Magic history for historical accuracy
- Flag inconsistencies for user review

## System Boundaries and Responsibilities

### Memory Bank Scope
**Memory Bank ONLY manages:**
- Project context and current state
- Technical decisions and system patterns
- Progress tracking and work focus
- Integration with Task Magic system

**Memory Bank NEVER manages:**
- AI agent behavior rules (.cursor/rules)
- Individual task file contents
- User preferences or workflow patterns
- System operation instructions

### Clear Separation
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Memory Bank Domain"
        MB1[Project Context]
        MB2[Technical Decisions]
        MB3[Progress Tracking]
        MB4[Work Focus]
    end
    
    subgraph "AI Agent Domain"
        AI1[Behavior Patterns]
        AI2[User Preferences]
        AI3[Learning Insights]
        AI4[Workflow Improvements]
    end
    
    subgraph "Task Magic Domain"
        TM1[Task Lifecycle]
        TM2[Dependencies]
        TM3[Execution Status]
        TM4[Historical Archive]
    end
    
    MB1 -.-> TM1
    MB3 -.-> TM3
    AI1 -.-> MB1
    AI3 -.-> MB2
```

## Critical Reminders

**REMEMBER**: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.

**MANDATORY BEHAVIOR**: 
- I MUST read ALL memory bank files at session start
- I MUST review ALL files when "update memory bank" is triggered
- I MUST maintain file hierarchy and dependencies
- I MUST focus Memory Bank updates on project context, not AI behavior rules

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Maintenance**: Update Memory Bank files consistently
2. **Context Preservation**: Maintain important context across updates
3. **Integration Awareness**: Consider both Memory Bank and Task Magic when making decisions
4. **User Communication**: Clearly indicate when Memory Bank updates occur
5. **Documentation Quality**: Ensure all files remain actionable and clear
6. **Pattern Recognition**: Actively identify and document recurring patterns
7. **Hierarchy Respect**: Follow file dependencies when reading and updating

This system provides the foundation for persistent AI agent memory while maintaining compatibility with the existing Task Magic framework and ensuring continuous learning through project intelligence capture.
