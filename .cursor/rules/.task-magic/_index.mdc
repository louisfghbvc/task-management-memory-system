# Task Magic System Overview

Whenever you use this rule, start your message with the following:

"Accessing Task Magic system overview..."

The Task Magic system is a file-based project management and AI agent operational framework designed to plan features, manage development tasks, and maintain a memory of past work. It integrates seamlessly with the Memory Bank system to provide persistent context across AI agent sessions.

The system consists of three main components, each governed by its own detailed rule file, plus Memory Bank integration:

1.  **Plans (`@plans.mdc`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Defines how Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) are created and structured for the overall project and specific features.
    *   **Location**: PRDs are stored in `.ai/plans/`, with feature-specific plans in `.ai/plans/features/`.
    *   **Key File**: A global `PLAN.md` is mandatory in `.ai/plans/`.
    *   **Details**: For plan creation, fully review [task-magic/plans.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/task-magic/plans.mdc)

2.  **Tasks (`@tasks.mdc`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Governs the creation, management, and lifecycle of individual development tasks.
    *   **Active Tasks**: All active tasks reside in `.ai/tasks/` as `task{id}_name.md` files.
    *   **Master View**: A master checklist, `.ai/TASKS.md`, mirrors the status of tasks in the `.ai/tasks/` directory and must be kept synchronized.
    *   **Details**: For task creation, fully review [task-magic/tasks.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/task-magic/tasks.mdc)

3.  **Memory (`@memory.mdc`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Archives completed and failed tasks to provide historical context.
    *   **Location**: Archived task files are stored in `.ai/memory/tasks/`.
    *   **Log File**: A chronological log of archived tasks is maintained in `.ai/memory/TASKS_LOG.md`.
    *   **Details**: For storing to memory, full review [task-magic/memory.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/task-magic/memory.mdc)

4.  **Memory Bank Integration (`@memory-bank.mdc`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Provides persistent context across AI agent sessions and integrates with Task Magic.
    *   **Location**: Memory Bank files stored in `memory-bank/` directory.
    *   **Integration**: Seamless synchronization between persistent context and operational history.
    *   **Details**: For Memory Bank operations, review [memory-bank.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc) and its modular components

This interconnected system allows for structured project development with persistent memory, from high-level planning to task execution, historical review, and continuous learning across AI agent sessions.
